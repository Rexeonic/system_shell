".gitignore" file stores all the files to be ignored (visible to all)

".git/info/exclude" stores files to be ignored (visible to just user)

.gitignore
----------
  will ignore all the file stated inside ".gitignore" from the directory in it file is present
  to all of its leaf directories.

  eg.  

  src/
  |
  |-- main.py
  |-- test.py
  |-- venv/
  |   |__ bin/
  |       |__ activate
  |       |__ python
  |
  .gitignore


  where .gitignore contains "ven/bin/activate"


Rooted Patterns
---------------
  Patterns starting with / are anchored to the directory containing the .gitignore file

  eg.  /main.py    (only main.py of the root directory will be ignored)

Negation
--------
  can negate a pattern by prefixing it with an exclamation mark (!)

  eg. 
     # ignore all .txt files except important.txt
     *.txt
     !important.txt
