Merge Base (aka best common ancestor) is the nearest ancestor in common to both branches.


                 (feature branch)

(Merge Base)⚪--⚫---⚫--⚪(merge commit)
              \           /
               \         /
                \       /
                ⚫----⚫
                (feature_branch)

To merge feature_branch into "main":
    # Run this while on main branch 
    $ git merge feature_branch



Plumbing of Merge:
    Step1:  Finds the "merge base" of the two branches
    Step2:  Replays changes from "feature_branch" onto "main" starting from merge base.
    Step3:  records the result as a new commit
    Step4:  it has 2 parents
