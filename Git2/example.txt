1. $ git clone userrepo.git

    Clones the forked repo on machine.

2. $ git remote add assignments-base https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/aesd-assignments.git

    the local repo remote is setted up.

3. $ git fetch assignments-base

    by default, $ git fetch   "also pulls metadata from the default remote"
    
    This downloads all new commits, branches, and tags from the 
    remote repository but does not modify your working directory or local branches.

    Best Practices
    --------------
Frequent Fetching: Regularly fetch updates to stay informed about changes in the remote repository.
Inspect Before Merging: Use git log or git diff to review fetched changes before merging.
Prune Stale Branches: Clean up references to deleted remote branches using
        $ git fetch --prune


4. $ git merge assignments-base/master

     local repo's master becomes up-to-date as with remote/master

5. $ git submodule update --init --recursive

      downloads all the files (even files inside sub-folder)
